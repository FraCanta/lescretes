These ladybirds were then carefully transported and released into the vineyard, as they were useful to fight the harmful mites. This activity was more than a game for the girls, and they were amused to observe them."

              "p": "Antoine, father of Constantine, ran the business until 1955 when olive oil began to arrive from other regions. It was therefore necessary to change production and the choice was to produce high quality wines. The attention was placed on the public and to stand out better started a process of customization at cultural level (separate vinification of crus), commercial (indication of geographical locations of each vineyard) and historical (preservation of native vines) that would have contributed to enhancing the Valle d'Aosta."

First by selecting vines that would otherwise have been lost in the mountains of the Aosta Valley: the Premetta (Prié Rouge), a rare endangered grape, whose grapes are now vinified in purity according to an innovative protocol in classic method sparkling wine and Fumin, another strain 'autochthonous', saved from extinction and vinified with striking results, so much so as to deserve already in 1999 the attention of the National critics with 'The sun of Luigi Veronelli'."
