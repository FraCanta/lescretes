        "p": "Valle d'Aosta is the European region with the greatest concentration of protected areas. 13% of the total area is occupied by parks, nature reserves and oases. The largest protected area is the Gran Paradiso National Park, followed by the Mont Avic Regional Park. Orographically it is divided in two by the Dora Baltea that flows in the central valley in a west-east direction, and highlights two sides, one shady exposed to the north called envers in the local dialect, and one sunny and arid facing south called adret. In the central Valley converge about twenty lateral valleys oriented along the north-south axis."
